Regression for age, classification for gender
idea played with for classificiton of age buckets, but went with reg  and then bucket that prediciton as this allowed loss funciton more info on how far away it would be so learning would be better (no info loss). 
- Defo wanted to go fo a classificaiton for age as regression would be too difficult to do with accuracy
